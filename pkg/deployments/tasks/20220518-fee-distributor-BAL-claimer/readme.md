# 2022-05-17 - Fee Distributor BAL Claimer

Deployment of the Fee Distributor BAL Claimer, which allows anyone to checkpoint the veBAL emissions gauge and direct those funds into the Fee Distributor. This gives assurances to veBAL holders that they will receive their BAL from this gauge without having to rely on a multisig to send these funds to the Fee Distributor.
